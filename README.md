# Human-Trafficking-Literature-Review
The provides the data used in our HT Literature Review paper. In addition there is a macro-enabled excel spreadsheet to explore the 142 studies more closely. 

In an effort to prolong the work presented in Dimas, Konrad, Maass, & Trapp (2022) [1].

We hope that together as a research community, we can continue to build upon the current tool to help those working at the intersection of HT and Operations Research and Applied Analytics and work towards better understanding the gaps and future directions for research. 

As an effort to do this we have created a google submission form where individuals can: 

1) Submit new (not currently included in [1]) you believe are relevant and fall within the scope of the present study

2) Submit revisions to works currently included in [1]

Each submission will be reviewed and those meeting the criteria outlined in Dimas et al (2022) will be added or revised. 

The dashboard tool found the github link provided below and will be updated semi-regularly by the authors: https://github.com/gldimas/Dimas-et.-al-2022_Human-Trafficking-Literature-Review 

Questions or concerns should be directed to: or.analytics.ht.lit.review@gmail.com
