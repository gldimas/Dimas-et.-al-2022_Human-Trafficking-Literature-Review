# Human-Trafficking-Literature-Review

This site hosts the data used in Dimas, Konrad, Maass, & Trapp (2022) "Operations Research and Analytics to combat human trafficking: A  systematic review of academic literature" [1]. In addition there is a macro-enabled excel spreadsheet that allows for a closer examination of the orginal 142 studies included in [1]. 

In an effort to prolong the work presented in [1] the authors have created a google submission form where individuals can: 

1) Submit new (not currently included in [1]) individuals believe are relevant and fall within the scope of the present study

2) Submit revisions to works currently included in [1]

Each submission will be reviewed and those meeting the criteria outlined in Dimas et al (2022) will be added or revised on a semi-regular basis.

Questions or concerns should be directed to: or.analytics.ht.lit.review@gmail.com 

The submission form can be found at the following link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnVEJNwTNpgRRT5Lyo_ZM5B0oOcqVlmaovTt1bKTE7SOfRVg/viewform?usp=sf_link
