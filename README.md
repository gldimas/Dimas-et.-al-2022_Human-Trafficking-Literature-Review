# Human-Trafficking-Literature-Review

This site hosts the data used in Dimas, Konrad, Maass, & Trapp (2022) "Operations Research and Analytics to combat human trafficking: A systematic review of academic literature" [1].

## Submission Form

In an effort to prolong the work presented in [1] the authors have created a google submission form where individuals can: 

1) *Submit new* (not currently included in [1]) individuals believe are relevant and fall within the scope of the present study

2) *Submit revisions* to works currently included in [1]

Each submission will be reviewed and those meeting the criteria outlined in Dimas et al (2022) will be added or revised on a semi-regular basis.

The submission form can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnVEJNwTNpgRRT5Lyo_ZM5B0oOcqVlmaovTt1bKTE7SOfRVg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
